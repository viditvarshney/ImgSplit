## Description for What we do 

In this Code Challenge I'm supposed to do basically 2 tasks
- Splits the original image to its 3 channels i.e., RGB
- and again obtain the original image from these three channels

## Run on the local machine (under development)

- Fork the repo
- make a folder in the root directory
- Clone the repo in that folder by the command <br>
  ` git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/hd-imaging-Code-Challenge.git`
  
- go to that directory
- and run the requirements.txt file <br>
  `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
  
- After all the dependencies are successfully installed
- Run the index.py file
- goto to the <br>
  `localhost:8090` in the browser
  
- Upload the image 
- That's it

***
### Then a window appears with four images , original image and all splited images,

- Then a new window appears by merging all three channels.
